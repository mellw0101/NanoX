1.
    Change it so that when using CTRL+(UP/DOWN) it stops at indent diffs.
    DONE!!!!.
2.
    Make prev_word stop at eol if done from start of next line.
    Also make it more intuative to use.
3.
    Fix both next_word and prev_word so that cut_next_word and cut_prev_word works properly.
4.
    Make it so that when text is marked and '/" is pressed it 'text'/"text". 
    DONE!!!!.
    p.s: i also added so that '{', '[' and '(' puts closing brackets around marked region,
    i.e: '{text}', '[text]' and '(text)'.
    @see @file 'cpp.cpp' @func 'enclose_marked_region'. 
5.
    Make 'to_next_block' and 'to_prev_block' stop at '//' comments top and bottom.
    Almost DONE, it currently stops at top when going up and bottom when going down.
6.
    Implement a way to close and open brackets (will probebly be very HARD!!!).
    funcs of intrest:
        'edit_refresh'
7.
    Implement live syntax.
    Almost done i just need to make a system to save types and structs of function calls
    and such for help and error checking, also make the syntax highlighting of func
    params local to function only and not global.
